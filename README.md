This project aims to leverage data analytics and machine learning to solve the problem of internal corrosion for Aramco. Given the serious impacts of internal corrosion, it is in the best interest of Aramco to reduce the costs spent on rectifying or monitoring corrosion in pipelines. 

Using the simulated corrosion dataset obtained from a reliable data source, our team employed various machine learning techniques, including Linear Regression and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) to develop models and identify factors influencing pipeline corrosion. 
Our analysis indicates that CO2 pressure and pH are the contributing factors to the corrosion rate of pipelines. Based on this finding, we developed 2 solutions for Aramco to target the aforementioned 2 factors. 

For carbon dioxide control, we suggest equipping Aramco's pipelines with carbon dioxide removal technology. By integrating it into their oil pipelines, we can effectively reduce CO2 pressure by capturing those CO2 emissions in the pipelines. However, the adaptation of Direct Air Removal technology in oil pipelines faces challenges, including its novelty to the industry, as companies like Aramco have yet to implement it, thus potentially requiring extensive pipeline modifications and a thorough cost-benefit analysis due to its economic implications. Despite these hurdles, if this technology is adopted, it could position Aramco at the forefront of innovation, enhancing its competitive stance in the oil industry.

For pH control, an automatic monitoring system with precise chemical dosing could be implemented, with careful selection of reactants to avoid adverse chemical reactions that might affect the purity of the oil obtained. Thus, this solution would require further consultation/collaboration with a professional chemist/chemical engineer with relevant domain knowledge.

The 2 solutions can be implemented in conjunction. By identifying the influencing factors, Aramco can identify potential pipeline corrosion and adjust those factors to reduce corrosion. From here, Aramco can conduct further analysis to implement measures to conduct timely predictive maintenance.
