# Predictive Analysis for Oil Pipeline Corrosion

## Overview
This project is dedicated to leveraging advanced data analytics and machine learning to tackle the challenge of internal corrosion in pipelines at Aramco. Internal corrosion is a significant issue for the oil and gas industry, leading to operational inefficiencies, substantial financial losses, and heightened safety and environmental risks.

Aramco, like many industry leaders, faces severe challenges due to pipeline corrosion, which are compounded by the global cost of corrosion estimated at approximately $2.5 trillion. This project aims to reduce these impacts through effective corrosion management strategies, enhanced by the latest technological advancements in data science.

## Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to empower Aramco with actionable insights to mitigate internal pipeline corrosion, which in turn will reduce operational costs and enhance pipeline safety and sustainability. Our approach involves:
- Identifying key factors that contribute to internal pipeline corrosion.
- Developing predictive models to forecast corrosion risks using machine learning.
- Proposing innovative solutions to manage and mitigate these risks.

## Methodology
Utilizing a simulated dataset sourced from a reliable data provider, our team has applied various machine learning techniques, including:
- **Linear Regression:** To understand the relationship between various factors and the rate of corrosion.
- **Classification and Regression Tree (CART):** To categorize data and make predictions about corrosion levels.

Our analysis has pinpointed CO2 pressure and pH levels as critical contributors to pipeline corrosion rates.

## Solutions Proposed
Based on our findings, we recommend the following strategies for Aramco:
1. **Carbon Dioxide Control:** Implement carbon dioxide removal technologies in pipelines to reduce CO2 pressure. This can be achieved by capturing CO2 emissions within the pipelines.
   - Challenges include the novelty of Direct Air Removal technology in the oil industry, which may necessitate significant pipeline modifications and a detailed cost-benefit analysis.
   - Despite potential obstacles, adopting this technology could position Aramco as a leader in industry innovation.

2. **pH Level Management:** Adjustments and monitoring systems to manage pH levels effectively, further details of which are explored within our project documentation and analysis outcomes.

## Conclusion
Embracing these technologies not only promises to decrease the incidence of corrosion but also places Aramco at the forefront of operational innovation, enhancing its competitive edge in the global oil market. By integrating advanced data analytics into their operational strategy, Aramco can significantly reduce the costs associated with corrosion management and improve overall pipeline integrity.
